To run this program, open Main.java, and run it.
A GUI will open. You can add Boids or Obstacles to the simulation and it will start to run.

The following are the Simulation Objects that you can add:
- Boids (Which Follow the Boids movement algorithm)
- Super Boids (Same as Boids, but faster and more "attractive")
- Sad Boids (Same as Boids, but rather than trying to group, they run away from other Boids at a slow pace)
- Trees (An obstacle that the Boids will avoid, stationary, destroys Boids on impact)
- Cars (Obstacles that move back and forth in straight lines, Boids will also avoid these, destroys Boids on impact)
- Windows (Obstacles that are stationary, Boids will *not* avoid these, because they can't see them, destroys Boids on impact)

You may also adjust the speed of the simulation at the bottom of the GUI, and can pause at any time.
