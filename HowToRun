Plague Inc Simulation – How to Run

    Project name: Plague Inc–Style Disease Simulation
    Authors: Landon Carothers and Lukas McAteer
    Environment tested with:
        Java SE 24
        NetBeans IDE 25
        Windows 11

    The project uses standard Java and Swing; there are no external libraries or data files required.

1. Files and Entry Point
    
    The project source lives under:
        src/main/java/jwp/

    Key files for running the simulation:
        App.java – Contains the main method and is the entry point of the program.
        MainFrame.java – Creates the main Swing window and attaches the simulation to the grid.
        GridPanel.java – Custom JPanel that draws the grid of cells and drives the periodic timer.
        PlagueIncSimulator.java – “Brain” of the simulation: movement, infection spread, recovery/death, cure progress.
        PlagueIncAgent.java and its subclasses:
            - HostAgent.java
            - HealthyHost.java
            - InfectedHost.java
            - RecoveredHost.java
            - VaccinatedHost.java
            - DeadHost.java
        You do not need to compile or run any of the host classes directly; they are used internally by
        PlagueIncSimulator.

2. Running the Project in an IDE (any Java IDE)
    You can run this project in any standard Java IDE (NetBeans, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.). The general steps are:
    
    1. Open / import the project
        - In your IDE, choose Open Project, Import Project, or similar.
        - Point it at the folder that contains the src directory and project metadata (for example, the folder 
          that also contains any nbproject or project configuration files).

    2. Make sure the JDK for the project is set
        - Configure the project to use a Java JDK (Java 17+ or Java 24, depending on the environment
          available in your lab).
        - Most IDEs let you do this through a Project SDK or Project Platform setting.

    3. Set the main class
        - In your IDE’s run configuration, set the main class to:
          jwp.App
        - This is the class that contains the public static void main(String[] args) method.

    4. Build and run
        - Use your IDE’s Run or Play button to build and launch the project.
        - The IDE will compile all the .java files and then run jwp.App.

    5. What you should see
        - A window titled "Plague" opens.
        - The window displays a square grid of colored cells:
            - Green “H” – Healthy hosts
            - Red “I” – Infected hosts
            - Blue “R” – Recovered hosts
            - Yellow “V” – Vaccinated hosts
            - Dark gray “X” – Dead hosts
            - Light gray – Empty cells with no host
        - The grid updates automatically on a timer; no keyboard/mouse interaction is required to see the simulation progress.

    6. Exiting the program
        - Close the window using the standard window close button (X in the corner).
        - The application will terminate cleanly.

3. Running from the Command Line (Optional)
    If you prefer to run it without an IDE:

    1. Open a terminal/command prompt in the project root (the folder that contains src).
    2. Compile:
        javac -d out src/jwp/*.java
    3. Run:
        java -cp out jwp.App
    
    The same "Plague" window will appear.

4. Simulation Behavior (What the GUI is Showing)
    - On startup, the simulator fills about 40% of the grid with hosts:
        - Most start Healthy.
        - Around 2% of the population starts Infected.
        - Around 10% starts Vaccinated.
    - Each tick:
        - Movement: Living hosts randomly attempt to move one cell (up/down/left/right) if the target cell is free.
        - Infection spread:
            - Infected hosts are the primary spreaders.
            - Recovered hosts can still spread the disease but at a weaker rate.
            - Infection only spreads to the four direct neighbors (no diagonals).
        - Vaccinated hosts:
            - Much harder to infect than Healthy hosts, but not completely immune.
        - Infection progression:
            - Infected hosts track an “infection age”. After a minimum duration, they have a chance each tick to either:
                - Recover (become blue “R”), or
                - Die (become dark gray “X”),
                  based on the current disease’s lethality.
        - Cure progress:
            - The simulation tracks a global “cure progress” value from 0.0 to 1.0.
            - Cure progress increases faster when:
                - The disease is more detectable, and
                - More hosts are infected or dead.
            - As cure progress increases, the effective infection probability is reduced, making it harder for the disease to continue spreading.
    - The simulation ends logically (internally) when:
        - Humanity wins – There are no infected hosts left, and at least one host is still alive (healthy, vaccinated, or recovered).
        - Plague wins – There are no infected hosts left, and all remaining hosts are dead.
    - When a terminal state is reached, a short message is printed to the console, but the GUI remains open so you can still see the final board.

5. Error Handling and Console Output
    - Under normal usage (just running and watching the GUI), the program should not throw exceptions.
    - We do not print debug spam to the console during normal operation.
    - The only console output used is:
        - Occasional end-of-simulation messages like:
            - "Plague eradicated! Some hosts survived."
            - "Everyone died. The plague has wiped out all hosts."
    - Closing the window is the normal way to exit the program.
